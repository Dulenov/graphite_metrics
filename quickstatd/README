quickstatd gathers OS-level performance statistics and sends
them to a running instance of Graphite.

To install quickstatd, run installer.sh.  Usage:

    sudo install.sh <install dir> <graphite host> <monitor interval> [ graphite port (default is 2003) ]


Quickstatd is controlled by a startup script in /etc/init.d.  Usage:

    /etc/init.d/quickstatd  start | stop | restart


To modify quickstatd settings (such as which metrics you wish to
monitor), edit /etc/quickstatd.conf.
